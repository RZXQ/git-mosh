# Cloning a Repository and Viewing Remotes

To clone a repository:

``` bash
git clone [https://github.com/codewithmosh/Mars.git](https://github.com/codewithmosh/Mars.git)
``` 

After cloning, you can list the existing remotes:

```bash
git remote
``` 

To view detailed remote URLs:

```bash
git remote -v
``` 

Expected output might look like:

```
origin [https://github.com/codewithmosh/Mars.git](https://github.com/codewithmosh/Mars.git) (fetch) origin [https://github.com/codewithmosh/Mars.git](https://github.com/codewithmosh/Mars.git) (push)
```
