# Rename file1.txt to main.js using system command
# Git sees this as: deletion of file1.txt + creation of untracked main.js
mv file1.txt main.js

# Stage the deletion of file1.txt (tells Git the original file is gone)
git add file1.txt
# Stage the new main.js file (tells Git to start tracking it)
git add main.js
# Result: Git recognizes this as a rename operation: "renamed: file1.txt -> main.js"

# Git's built-in rename command - handles both filesystem AND Git operations
# Renames main.js to file1.js in working directory and stages the change automatically
git mv main.js file1.js

# Commit all the rename operations
git commit -m "Refactor code."
