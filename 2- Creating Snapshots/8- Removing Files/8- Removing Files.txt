# Remove file2.txt from working directory only (not from Git's staging area)
rm file2.txt

# List all files currently tracked by Git (file2.txt still appears here)
git ls-files

# Stage the deletion of file2.txt (tells Git to remove it from the repository)
git add file2.txt

# Commit the deletion with a message
git commit -m "remove unused code"

# Alternative shorthand approach:
# Remove files from both working directory AND staging area in one command
git rm file2.txt file1.txt
